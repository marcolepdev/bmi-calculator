### Information about the App 
This small application is widget component that allows the user to see and check if their own pet is underweight, normalwet and overweight.


### Technologies used 
I developed this app with Html, Sass/Scss and Vanilla Js

### How it works 
The user can:

- insert a value between 0 and 120, to check the pet's weight (the range bar will adjust automatically). Decimals numbers are accepted to (to a maximum of a 2cyphers).
- use the range bar to search the desidered value
- check and read wether the weight is ok or not

The app will automatically show some colored banners below the range input, telling the user more info about the weight.

Important: In case the user inserts value, that are over or below the afore-mentioned values, the app will automatically show the user an error and tell them what to do.
